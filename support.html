                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What are streak goals?</h3>
                        <p>Streak goals are optional targets you can set for each habit. They help you stay motivated by giving you a specific number of consecutive days to aim for. Once you reach your goal, you'll unlock special achievements!</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How are streaks calculated?</h3>
                        <p>Your streak counts consecutive days where you've completed a habit. If you complete a habit today, your streak includes today. If you haven't completed it today but did yesterday, your streak continues. Missing a day breaks your streak.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I restore a broken streak?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! Streak Storm includes a streak restore feature available as an in-app purchase. This allows you to restore a broken streak once per habit, perfect for those times when life gets in the way of your goals.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What happens if I miss a day?</h3>
                        <p>If you don't complete a habit for a full day (and the previous day), your streak will reset to zero. However, you can continue building your habit from that point forward, or use the streak restore feature if available.</p>
